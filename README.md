# Soundscapes Analysis Template

This repository provides a template for analyzing soundscapes using python. The project was created with the intention of offering an easy-to-use and reproducible framework that can be used by researchers, conservation biologists, citizen scientists, and anyone else interested in ecoacoustics and soundscape ecology.

## Background

Soundscapes are composed of all sounds occurring in a given habitat, including biological sounds such as animal vocalizations and non-biological sounds like wind and water. Analyzing soundscapes can provide valuable information about species richness, habitat quality, and ecological changes over time. 

The Python programming language has become key for analyzing soundscapes since it is an open-source language and provides numerous scientific libraries for manipulating sound data. This project provides a template for organizing sound data analysis code and provides an example of how to analyze sound recordings in the .wav format.

## Installation Instructions

To get started with this project, you will need to clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/juansulloa/pamflow.git
```

Then, install the required packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Organize directories
Organize files accorind to [this structure](#directory-structure).
    - Sound files must be organized into subdirectories based on the recording device.
    - Rename the directory where you have this repository as 'workflows'.
    - Create the output directories and its subdirectories 'figures' and 'metadata' and others.

### 2. Set configuration
Edit the `config.yaml` file in the root directory to adjust the settings according to your analysis needs.
The file is prefilled with default parameters.

### 3. Run scripts
Run the scripts to prepare the data and extract audio features. 

#### 3.1. Preprocessing
**Add file prefix**
```bash
python -m pamflow.preprocess.cli add_file_prefix -i <input_dir> -r
```
**Get metadata**
```bash
python -m pamflow.preprocess.cli get_audio_metadata -i <input_dir> -o <output_file>
```
**Plot sensor deployment**
```bash
python -m pamflow.plot.cli sensor_deployment -i ../output/metadata/metadata_extra.csv
```
**Timelapse**
```bash
python -m pamflow.preprocess.cli audio_timelapse -i <input_dir> -o <output_dir>
```
**Plot spectrograms for multiple files**
```bash
python -m pamflow.plot.cli spectrogram -i <input_dir>
```

#### 3.2. Compute acoustic indices
```bash
python -m pamflow.acoustic_indices.cli -i <input_dir> -o <output_dir>
```
#### 3.3. Compute graphical soundscapes
Test configuration
```bash
python -m pamflow.graphical_soundscape.cli spectrogram_local_max -i <input_file>
```
Run for all files
```bash
python -m pamflow.graphical_soundscape.cli graphical_soundscape -i <input_dir> -o <output_dir>
```

### 4. Visualize and perform statistical analiyses
Since the statistical analyses are project-dependent, specific visualization tools should be chosen to aid in the process.

- `config.yaml`: configuration file for specifying input/output directories, settings, and parameters.
- `data/`: directory containing sound files organized into subdirectories based on location or device. I usually have this data in a harddrive and I make a symbolik link using `ln -s <source_dir> <target_dir>`.
- `pamflow/`: directory containing scripts for loading data, feature extraction, data visualization, and statistical analysis.
- `input/`: directory containing input files comming from field data and manual annotations.
- `output/`: directory containing output files generated by the workflows.
- `README.md`: Adjust this file providing an overview of the project.
- `requirements.txt`: file listing all Python packages required to run the analisys.
